# Realtime DIY Hydrometric Data Logger with Arduino Feather M0

# Introduction

This project that allows you to measure and log hydrometric data in real-time using an Arduino Feather M0 microcontroller. This project is perfect for environmental monitoring applications, such as river water level measurements, flood monitoring, and water quality assessment.

With this hydrometric data logger, you can collect water level data and transmit it to your e-mail or a cloud service for real-time monitoring and analysis. The use of the Arduino Feather M0 ensures low power consumption and compatibility with various sensors, making it a versatile and reliable solution for your hydrometric data logging needs.
