# Version 0.5 - Adding Libraries


Author: Rachel Pagdin


## Library add log: 

### Dec 20, 2023:
- added blinky to library --> tested independently, integrated (compiled) into general_purpose_hydros.ino
- added read_params to library --> compiled fine with general_purpose_hydros.ino, not sure how to test independently


Notes:
- all of the setup could probably be moved to the library --> need to see if it is the same between all the .ino files
- how do I test functionality of the whole system? need access to the readings? 
- eventually add more comments, code will also be more readable with the library
